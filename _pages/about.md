Hello there! I am Zian WANG Peter. I received the B.Eng. degree (with Honors) in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/?sc_lang=en), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2025, supervised by [Prof. Ivan Ho Wang-Hei](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/eee/people/academic-staff-and-teaching-staff/dr-ho-ivan/). I am currently pursuing an M.Phil. degree in [Department of Data and Systems Engineering](https://www.dase.hku.hk/) at the University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Chen Sun](https://chensunmac.github.io/). Our research group directed by Prof. Sun is called [Safe Autonomous Systems Lab](https://hku-sas.hku.hk/). It is a multidisciplinary research team that combines expertise in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer vision, and human-machine interaction to create breakthrough technologies that advance the field of autonomous systems. 

My current research interests include broad topics in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation systems, time-series analysis with fault diagnosis, and SLAM.

I am passionate about exploring grand challenges and creating innovative solutions. Through different entrepreneurship competition experiences, I have also acquired analytical, logistical, and writing skills that enable me to conduct research and develop business ideas. I have also pursued diverse academic opportunities in overseas studies, joining [exchange programme at DTU, Denmark](https://youtu.be/B7oA12MpVZc?si=FvIFWEdXofnySJdp), and [exchange programme at NTU, Singapore](https://ntu-sa.terradotta.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgramAngular&id=11025), where I learned about programming, data processing, and human-computer interaction. Additionally, I have received multiple scholarships and awards, such as the Dr Winnie S M Tang-PolyU Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Scholarship, the Merit Award at the [Microcontroller Application Design Contest](https://www.eie.polyu.edu.hk/event/madc2022-23/), HKSAR Government Scholarship Fund, and Championship at the 2023-24 HKAE Pitch Competition, where I apply my pitch and research skills to address complex and interdisciplinary problems.
